/**
 * Collection supporting fast iteration.
 *
 * <p>A fast collection is a collection that may support <em>fast iteration</em>
 * â€” iteration where the same object is returned each time, having been mutated
 * to represent the next state.  It can save greatly in object allocation
 * overhead in some circumstances.  Using a fast iterator is only possible if
 * the looping code doesn't allow objects returned by the iterator to escape the
 * loop (e.g. it doesn't save them away in other objects or something), but many
 * loops only observe the object and then discard it before the next iteration.
 * Those loops benefit from fast iterators.
 *
 * @param <E> The type of value in the fast collection.
