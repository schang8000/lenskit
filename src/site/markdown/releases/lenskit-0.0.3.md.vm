This release contains many large changes, including significant
architectural and API changes to make it easier to take LensKit
forward.  Highlights include:

-   Dropped our use of Guice for dependency injection and
    configuration.  Recommenders are now configured with the
    `LenskitRecommenderComponentFactory` class.  PicoContainer
    provides the underlying infrastructure, but this will be changing
    in the future.

-   Renamed and refactored classes in the recommender implementations
    to improve clarity and consistency.
    
-   Upgraded to Maven 3 (#issue(38)); Maven 2 is currently unsupported
    for building LensKit.  LensKit can, of course, be used by Maven 2
    projects without problem.

-   Lots of documentation improvements.

-   Introduce `ImmutableSparseVector` and build more robust
    type-checking for mutability guarantees on sparse vectors.

-   Drop thread safety guarantee on `UserRatingProfile`. Many
    profile implementations will likely be thread-safe, but we're not
    promising it any more.

-   Add a session concept to data access objects to make it easier to
    deal with database handle scoping and related issues.

-   Use Ant to manage evaluations.  This allows for more flexible
    evaluation processing setups.
