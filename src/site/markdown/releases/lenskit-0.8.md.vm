-   Cleaned up cursor utilities, moving all methods from
    `Cursors2` to `Cursors`.  The old `Cursors2` methods
    are deprecated and will be removed before 1.0 is released.

-   Implemented a new evaluation framework that uses XML files to
    directly configure evaluators (#issue(115)).  This replaces the
    Ant plugin.  Eventually, a Maven plugin will be added that runs
    these evaluations; for now, they can be run with
    [exec-maven-plugin](http://mojo.codehaus.org/exec-maven-plugin).
    See the `lenskit-eval-demo` project configuration for an
    example.  With this comes the fix for #issue(115) as well.

-   Provide example evaluation configurations run as integration
    tests.  `lenskit-eval` contains a basic one, and
    `lenskit-eval-demo` contains a more extensive set complete
    with R-based post-analysis.  To run these, activate the
    `smoketest` profile and set the
    `grouplens.mldata.acknowledge` property to `yes` to
    acknowledge that you are abiding by the licensing terms for the
    [MovieLens ML100K data set](http://www.grouplens.org/node/73),
    which is automatically downloaded and used by the demo
    evaluations.
