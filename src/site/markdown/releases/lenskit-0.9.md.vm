-   Clean up documentation, warnings, and documenting annotations in
    several places. Also made many style fixes.

-   Fix the `ItemScorer` inheritance hierarchy by making
    `AbstractItemScorer` implement `ItemScorer` rather than
    `RatingPredictor`, and make subclasses implement
    `RatingPredictor` directly.
  
-   Revise `SparseVector` definition and implementations to have a
    well-defined notion of "key domain" and "key set", where the key set
    is the set of keys with values drawn from the key domain. This allows
    `MutableSparseVector`s to be used to build up vectors in a well-defined
    fashion without using NaN. With this update, the `keySet` method will
    only return defined keys (use `keyDomain` to access the key domain), and
    NaN will only show up due to mathematical error, never due to temporary slots
    being unfilled.
    
-   Updated versions of several dependencies.

-   `EventCollectionDAO` factory updates - add `wrap` methods that wrap other
    DAO factories in immediate or soft event collection DAO factories, making it easier
    to use `EventCollectionDAO` for a cache of disk-backed DAOs.  Also made the
    `SoftFactory` take a `Supplier` rather than `Provider`.


## Evaluation runner

-   Output separate data set and segment number fields.
   
-   Support fractional (e.g. 20%) holdouts in addition to remove-K.
   
-   Reinstate per-user MAE (MAE.ByUser).

-   Use `.eval-cache` as default cache directory.

-   Add evaluation listener framework for future evaluation monitor consoles.

-   Renamed profile for running the evaluation demo - it is now activated with
    `demo` (rather than `smoketest`).

-   Rearrange evaluator code to the crossfolding logic is in its own package.
   

## Cleanup

Several unused classes have been removed:

-   `IndexedItemScore`
   
-   `IntSortedArraySet`
