-   `PreferenceDomain` now uses a precision of 0 to represent a continuous scale.  The
    precision was previously undefined.

-   Added `RatingBuilder` to build ratings.

-   Deprecated `Event.copy`; specific event builders should be used to copy events.

-   Added type-safe side channels of arbitrary data to vectors.

-   Replaced many public fields with methods in `FunkSVDModel`.


## Evaluator

  The evaluator has seen heavy refactoring and rewrite in 1.2.  Eval scripts are mostly compatible;
  these notes focus on user-visible differences.  Code that directly used the eval classes will
  likely need updates that are not described here.

-   For tasks (which replace commands), the eval config is available as the `evalConfig`
    property (rather than the old `config`).  `config` is still available as a top-level
    property on the script; it is also accessible as `eval.config`, with the new `eval`
    property that makes the script accessible by name.

-   Renamed `Command.getConfig())` to `Command.getEvalConfig()`. Also renamed the setter.

-   The simple evaluator is now called `SimpleEvaluator`, not `SimpleEvalCommand`. It no
    longer takes a name.
