The first beta release!  What this means for the future is that our
core APIs (such as the recommenders and predictors) are pretty
stable, and future changes to them will be documented and called out
in the release notes.  In general, future release notes will be more
detailed, as we're working on adding more features and stabilizing
LensKit to a 1.0 release.

This release contains many changes.  Highlights include:

-   Restructuring of recommendation and prediction interfaces to keep
    rating-based recommendation cleanly separated from more generic
    interfaces and facilitate reuse of predictor-based recommendation
    logic.

-   Removed `ScoredId` in favor of `ScoredLongList` for the
    recommendation API.

-   Added Slope-One recommenders.

-   Lots of bugfixes.

-   Increased parallelism in the evaluators (evaluators are now
    parallized per-configuration rather than per-dataset, decreasing
    memory requirements for parallel evaluation, and evaluation tasks
    are aggregated from all data sets into a single work queue and
    thread pool to keep your CPU cores pegged).

-   Allow arbitrary recommender components to be extracted with
    `LenskitRecommender`'s new `getComponent` method.  This
    allows client code to examine things like the item-item similarity
    matrix.

-   More test cases and lots more API documentation.

Keep watching LensKit for further developments and lots of exciting
new work this summer.
