/**
 * Snapshot of the ratings data for building a recommender.
 *
 * <p>
 * The recommender build process often needs to take multiple passes over the
 * rating data. In a live system, the data provided by a
 * {@link DataAccessObject} may change between iterations. Therefore, we
 * introduce <em>build contexts</em> &mdash; snapshots of the rating data at
 * a particular point in time that can be iterated as many times as necessary to
 * build the recommender.
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementers have a variety of options for implementing build contexts. They
 * can be in-memory snapshots, database transactions, database clones, or even
 * disk files. Recommender build code does assume, however, that multiple
 * iterations is pretty fast. Therefore, implementations should avoid
 * re-fetching the data over a network connection for each request.
 *
 * <p>
 * An additional feature provided by build contexts is that of mapping the item
 * and user IDs to consecutive, 0-based indices. The indices <strong>may
 * differ</strong> from one build context to another.
